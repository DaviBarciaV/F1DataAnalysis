# F1DataAnalysis
Historical analysis of Formula 1 data (1950-2022). Python (Pandas, Plotly) was used for EDA and prototyping, and Power BI for the final dashboard visualization.

# 🏎️ Formula 1 - Historical Analysis (1950 - 2022)

## 📄 Overview
This project performs a historical analysis of Formula 1 racing data spanning from 1950 to 2022. The goal was to uncover patterns, driver statistics, and country performance over the decades.

This repository contains the **Python scripts** used for the initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and chart prototyping, which served as the foundation for a comprehensive **Power BI Dashboard**.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
The workflow was divided into two main stages:

### 1. Prototyping & Analysis (Python)
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **NumPy & Pandas:** Used for data manipulation, cleaning, and aggregation.
* **Plotly:** Used to generate interactive chart sketches and validate visual concepts before moving to the production dashboard.

### 2. Final Visualization
* **Power BI:** Used to create the final interactive dashboard, featuring decade segmentation and advanced filtering.

## 📊 Key Insights & Visuals
The analysis focuses on several key metrics:
* **Pole Position vs. Victory Correlation:** Analyzing how starting first impacts the race result.
* **"Kings without a Crown":** Drivers with the most wins who never won a World Championship.
* **Podiums without Victories:** Drivers consistent enough to reach the podium but missed the top spot.
* **Geographic Analysis:** Podium distribution by country.
* **Decade Segmentation:** Ability to filter data by specific eras (e.g., 2010s, 2020s).

## 📂 Data Source
The dataset used for this project was sourced from **Kaggle**, covering F1 seasons from 1950 to 2022.
* *Dataset:* [Formula 1 World Championship (1950 - 2022)
